NOP - Functional programming and LISP in C#
===========================================

NOP project is still in its early stages, so it is not yet very useful. The goal is to build a LISP-like language and an S-expression editor. The implementation is still very much in flux - I will document the code in more detail once the foundation gets more stable.

Building
--------

The is developed with MonoDevelop, but it can be compiled with Visual Studio 2010 as well. It requires GTK# framework to be installed.
